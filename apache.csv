All I wanted to do today was to write a redirect rule to a subfolder, e.g.:
You enter the URL: example.com and you get redirected to example.com/subfolder
Such a simple wish. I tried to find a solution on the internet. The internet told me to add an .htaccess file in the htdocs root with:

I did this. But no success obviously, they didn't told me I had to uncomment the module in httpd.conf:

So I did this too. No success again. They didn't told me I had to change my httpd.conf so that the .htaccess file would be enabled:

Again no success, because I get this error when entering the URL:

I first used wordpress's wp_remote_request call and also tried to use curl in php.
Both (as expected) give the same error message:

Note: when I curl POST to HTTP it works fine.
I reckon it is a setting in PHP.ini or in my apache (I lost my original HTTPD.conf file after upgrade...).
Can anyone help me out?","
I've seen this error happen when php is compiled with a version of cURL that uses Apple's Secure Transport under Yosemite and the target of the URL request doesn't support SSLv3 (which was probably disabled due to the POODLE vulnerability). What is the output of this command?
$ php -i | grep ""SSL Version""

I suspect you'll see this:
SSL Version => SecureTransport

You can overcome this by installing a version of php which uses a version of cURL which uses OpenSSL instead of SecureTransport. This is most easily done with homebrew. So install that first if you don't already have it. If homebrew is installed but you haven't run brew update since upgrading to Yosemite, do that first. Also make sure you've installed XCode >= 6.1 and the latest XCode command line tools. brew doctor will tell you if you've done it all right.
Add the Homebrew taps below that you will need in order to get brewed php installed. Skip this step if these repos are already tapped. If you're unsure if these repos are already tapped, just run the commands below. Worst case scenario, you'll get a harmless Warning: Already tapped!
$ brew tap homebrew/dupes
$ brew tap homebrew/versions
$ brew tap homebrew/php

Then install curl with openssl:
$ brew install --with-openssl curl

Then install php using the curl you just installed and brewed openssl:
$ brew install --with-homebrew-curl --with-httpd24 php55


if using apache, make sure to add LoadModule php5_module    /usr/local/opt/php55/libexec/apache2/libphp5.so to your /etc/apache2/httpd.conf and restart apache.
if not using apache 2.4, you can remove --with-httpd24 from the above command.
if using nginx, follow the caveat instuctions for starting fpm:

To launch php-fpm on startup:
mkdir -p ~/Library/LaunchAgents
cp /usr/local/opt/php55/homebrew.mxcl.php55.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents/
launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.php55.plist



Install any php extensions you're going to need eg. mcrypt.
$ brew install php55-mcrypt

After you're done, run this again:
$ php -i | grep ""SSL Version""

And you should see:
SSL Version => OpenSSL/1.0.2h

And now, re-test your application and the SSLRead() return error -9806 should go away.

I followed Most of the answers in the internet But I still get the same Message

It is weird that when I access using the same PC to localhost:1234 it runs normally but if I access using my IP address 192.168.0.188:1234 
Also which is really weird is that I tried to install WAMP on other PC and without any configuration I could access to that PC.
So I thought it's because McAfee and Firewall so I open port on Widows and McAfee and nothing changed also I turned off Firewall and still nothing change.
Then for no reason I opened  port through the Router 闂備胶鍋ㄩ崕鑼箔椤＄t forwarding ?and still nothing changed.
I don't think that it's because my configuration in WAMP since I am still able to get this 403 Forbidden Message and also by using other PC without any configuration I could access it.
Both PCs are setup like this:
Windows 8 Pro

WAMP Wampserver: 2.4 
Apache Version: 2.4.4  
PHP Version: 5.4.12  
MySQL Version: 5.6.12  

The accessible PC uses Microsoft Security Essentials.
The inaccessible PC uses McAfee Internet Security.
I tried to turn off WAMP and start IIS For Microsoft Server (I works perfectly From any PC) but WAMP is still not not working
I followed these tutorial: 

How to Access WAMP Server in LAN or WAN
Install & Setup Virtual Host Guide for WAMP
Install & Setup LAN & Worldwide Access Guide for WAMP

And the Stack Overflow answers here: 

Cannot access wamp server on local network
WAMP 403 Forbidden message on Windows 7","
If you are using WAMPServer 3 See bottom of answer
For WAMPServer versions <= 2.5
By default Wampserver comes configured as securely as it can, so Apache is set to only allow access from the machine running wamp. Afterall it is supposed to be a development server and not a live server.
Also there was a little error released with WAMPServer 2.4 where it used the old Apache 2.2 syntax instead of the new Apache 2.4 syntax for access rights.
You need to change the security setting on Apache to allow access from anywhere else, so edit your httpd.conf file.
Change this section from :
#   onlineoffline tag - don't remove
     Order Deny,Allow
     Deny from all
     Allow from 127.0.0.1
     Allow from ::1
     Allow from localhost

To :
#   onlineoffline tag - don't remove
    Require local
    Require ip 192.168.0

The Require local allows access from these ip's 127.0.0.1 & localhost & ::1.
The statement Require ip 192.168.0 will allow you to access the Apache server from any ip on your internal network. Also it will allow access using the server mechines actual ip address from the server machine, as you are trying to do.
WAMPServer 3 has a different method
In version 3 and > of WAMPServer there is a Virtual Hosts pre defined for localhost so you have to make the access privilage amendements in the Virtual Host definition config file
First dont amend the httpd.conf file at all, leave it as you found it.
Using the menus, edit the httpd-vhosts.conf file.

It should look like this :
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName localhost
    DocumentRoot D:/wamp/www
    <Directory  ""D:/wamp/www/"">
        Options +Indexes +FollowSymLinks +MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require local
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

Amend it to
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerName localhost
    DocumentRoot D:/wamp/www
    <Directory  ""D:/wamp/www/"">
        Options +Indexes +FollowSymLinks +MultiViews
        AllowOverride All
        Require all granted
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

Hopefully you will have created a Virtual Host for your project and not be using the wamp\www folder for your site. In that case leave the localhost definition alone and make the change only to your Virtual Host.
Dont forget to restart Apache after making this change

SSL23_GET_SERVER_HELLO:unknown protocol

This error happens when OpenSSL receives something other than a ServerHello in a protocol version it understands from the server.  It can happen if the server answers with a plain (unencrypted) HTTP.  It can also happen if the server only supports e.g. TLS 1.2 and the client does not understand that protocol version.  Normally, servers are backwards compatible to at least SSL 3.0 / TLS 1.0, but maybe this specific server isn't (by implementation or configuration).
It is unclear whether you attempted to pass --no-check-certificate or not.  I would be rather surprised if that would work.
A simple test is to use wget (or a browser) to request http://example.com:443 (note the http://, not https://); if it works, SSL is not enabled on port 443.  To further debug this, use openssl s_client with the -debug option, which right before the error message dumps the first few bytes of the server response which OpenSSL was unable to parse.  This may help to identify the problem, especially if the server does not answer with a ServerHello message.  To see what exactly OpenSSL is expecting, check the source: look for SSL_R_UNKNOWN_PROTOCOL in ssl/s23_clnt.c.
In any case, looking at the apache error log may provide some insight too.

(edit, thanks delboy1978uk)
The error could be avoided if applied a simple best practice: pin your docker images to a specific version instead of latest. 

After digging the commits of the official httpd image, I found the solution. (maybe this question/answer may help others)

For those who stumble onto this note while looking for a solution,
  just add LoadModule mpm_event_module modules/mod_mpm_event.so into
   httpd.conf above the other LoadModule directives.

(from the comments on the commit #17166574)
So, because I was overriding the file /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf without explicitly declare an MPM module, after this commit, my image started to fail.
With this quick fix, everything is fine now.
For the complete correction, add this to your httpd.conf file (thanks svinther):
LoadModule mpm_event_module modules/mod_mpm_event.so
#LoadModule mpm_prefork_module modules/mod_mpm_prefork.so
#LoadModule mpm_worker_module modules/mod_mpm_worker.so

or, for a more future-proof solution, you could modify the original http.conf file using sed.

A checksum exception is being thrown when trying to read from or transfer a file. 
The strange thing is that some files are being successfully copied while others are not (I tried with 2 files, one is slightly bigger than the other, both are small in size though). Another observation that I have made is that the Java FileSystem.getFileChecksum method, is returning a null in all cases.
A slight background on what I am trying to achieve: I am trying to write a file to hdfs, to be able to use it as a distributed cache for the mapreduce job that I have written.
I have also tried the hadoop fs -copyFromLocal command from the terminal, and the result is the exact same behaviour as when it is done through the java code.
I have looked all over the web, including other questions here on stackoverflow however I haven't managed to solve the issue. Please be aware that I am still quite new to hadoop so any help is greatly appreciated.
I am attaching the stack trace below which shows the exceptions being thrown. (In this case I have posted the stack trace resulting from the hadoop fs -copyFromLocal command from terminal)","
You are probably hitting the bug described in HADOOP-7199. What happens is that when you download a file with copyToLocal, it also copies a crc file in the same directory, so if you modify your file and then try to do copyFromLocal, it will do a checksum of your new file and compare to your local crc file and fail with a non descriptive error message.
To fix it, please check if you have this crc file, if you do  just remove it and try again.

function getSSLPage($url) {
    $ch = curl_init();
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, false);
    curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $url);

When you set the SSL Version with curl to v3 then it works.
Edit:
Another problem under Windows is that you don't have access to the certificates. So put the root certificates directly to curl.
http://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html
here you can download the root certificates.
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_CAINFO, __DIR__ . ""/certs/cacert.pem"");
curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, true);

Then you can use the CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER option with true otherwise you get an error.

Editing config/config.yml and replacing save_path: ""%kernel.root_dir%/../var/sessions/%kernel.environment%"" with save_path: /var/lib/php/sessions fixed the error.

It works fine in HTTP mode, but when I run $ sudo certbot --apache to set up HTTPS, it fails with the error Syntax error on line 7 of /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf: Name duplicates previous WSGI daemon definition.  Line 7 is the line beginning with WSGIDaemonProcess.","
It turns out that if my Apache conf file 000-default.conf only declares <VirtualHost *:80>...</VirtualHost>, then Certbot duplicates it and creates a second Apache conf file called 000-default-le-ssl.conf to define <VirtualHost *:443>...</VirtualHost>.
The Name duplicates previous WSGI daemon definition error appears because both Apache conf files have the same line defining WSGIDaemonProcess myprocess....  This appears to be a known Certbot bug.
The workaround I've found is to define both VirtualHosts (80 and 443) in the same Apache conf file (so that Certbot doesn't create a second file), and to define WSGIDaemonProcess outside both VirtualHosts, like this:
WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
WSGIDaemonProcess myprocess user=ubuntu group=ubuntu threads=10 home=/home/ubuntu/myapp

To parse an Apache access_log log in PHP you can use this regex:
$regex = '/^(\S+) (\S+) (\S+) \[([^:]+):(\d+:\d+:\d+) ([^\]]+)\] \""(\S+) (.*?) (\S+)\"" (\S+) (\S+) ""([^""]*)"" ""([^""]*)""$/';
preg_match($regex ,$log, $matches);

To match the Apache error_log format, you can use this regex:
$regex = '/^\[([^\]]+)\] \[([^\]]+)\] (?:\[client ([^\]]+)\])?\s*(.*)$/i';
preg_match($regex, $log, $matches);
$matches[1] = Date and time,           $matches[2] = severity,
$matches[3] = client addr (if present) $matches[4] = log message

It matches lines with or without the client:

What should the optimal values be to set in apache?
#/etc/sysconfig/memcached

/etc/my.cnf","
When you use Apache with mod_php apache is enforced in prefork mode, and not worker. As, even if php5 is known to support multi-thread, it is also known that some php5 libraries are not behaving very well in multithreaded environments (so you would have a locale call on one thread altering locale on other php threads, for example).
So, if php is not running in cgi way like with  php-fpm you have mod_php inside apache and apache in prefork mode.
On your tests you have simply commented the prefork settings and increased the worker settings, what you now have is default values for prefork settings and some altered values for the shared ones :
StartServers       20
MinSpareServers    5
MaxSpareServers    10
MaxClients         1024
MaxRequestsPerChild  0

This means you ask apache to start with 20 process, but you tell it that, if there is more than 10 process doing nothing it should reduce this number of children, to stay between 5 and 10 process available. The increase/decrease speed of apache is 1 per minute. So soon you will fall back to the classical situation where you have a fairly low number of free available apache processes (average 2). The average is low because usually you have something like 5 available process, but as soon as the traffic grows they're all used, so there's no process available as apache is very slow in creating new forks. This is certainly increased by the fact your PHP requests seems to be quite long, they do not finish early and the apache forks are not released soon enough to treat another request. 
See on the last graphic the small amount of green before the red peak? If you could graph this on a 1 minute basis instead of 5 minutes you would see that this green amount was not big enough to take the incoming traffic without any error message.
Now you set 1024 MaxClients. I guess the cacti graph are not taken after this configuration modification, because with such modification, when no more process are available, apache would continue to fork new children, with a limit of 1024 busy children. Take something like 20MB of RAM per child (or maybe you have a big memory_limit in PHP and allows something like 64MB or 256MB and theses PHP requests are really using more RAM), maybe a DB server... your server is now slowing down because you have only 768MB of RAM. Maybe when apache is trying to initiate the first 20 children you already reach the available RAM limit.
So. a classical way of handling that is to check the amount of memory used by an apache fork (make some top commands while it is running), then find how many parallel request you can handle with this amount of RAM (that mean parallel apache children in prefork mode). Let's say it's 12, for example. Put this number in apache mpm settings this way:
<IfModule prefork.c>
  StartServers       12
  MinSpareServers    12
  MaxSpareServers    12
  MaxClients         12
  MaxRequestsPerChild  300
</IfModule>

That means you do not move the number of fork while traffic increase or decrease, because you always want to use all the RAM and be ready for traffic peaks. The 300 means you recyclate each fork after 300 requests, it's better than 0, it means you will not have potential memory leaks issues. MaxClients is set to 12 25 or 50 which is more than 12 to handle the ListenBacklog queue, which can enqueue some requests, you may take a bigger queue, but you would get some timeouts maybe (removed this strange sentende, I can't remember why I said that, if more than 12 requests are incoming the next one will be pushed in the Backlog queue, but you should set MaxClient to your targeted number of processes).
And yes, that means you cannot handle more than 12 parallel requests.
If you want to handle more requests:

buy some more RAM
try to use apache in worker mode, but remove mod_php and use php as a parallel daemon with his own pooler settings (this is called php-fpm), connect it with fastcgi. Note that you will certainly need to buy some RAM to allow a big number of parallel php-fpm process, but maybe less than with mod_php
Reduce the time spent in your php process. From your cacti graphs you have to potential problems: a real traffic peak around 11:25-11:30 or some php code getting very slow. Fast requests will reduce the number of parallel requests.

If your problem is really traffic peaks, solutions could be available with caches, like a proxy-cache server. If the problem is a random slowness in PHP then... it's an application problem, do you do some HTTP query to another site from PHP, for example?
And finally, as stated by @Jan Vlcinsky you could try nginx, where php will only be available as php-fpm. If you cannot buy RAM and must handle a big traffic that's definitively desserve a test.
Update: About internal dummy connections (if it's your problem, but maybe not).
Check this link and this previous answer. This is 'normal', but if you do not have a simple virtualhost theses requests are maybe hitting your main heavy application, generating slow http queries and preventing regular users to acces your apache processes. They are generated on graceful reload or children managment. 
If you do not have a simple basic ""It works"" default Virtualhost prevent theses requests on your application by some rewrites:
  RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^.*internal\ dummy\ connection.*$ [NC]
  RewriteRule .* - [F,L]

Update:
Having only one Virtualhost does not protect you from internal dummy connections, it is worst, you are sure now that theses connections are made on your unique Virtualhost. So you should really avoid side effects on your application by using the rewrite rules.
Reading your cacti graphics, it seems your apache is not in prefork mode bug in worker mode. Run httpd -l or apache2 -l on debian, and check if you have worker.c or prefork.c. If you are in worker mode you may encounter some PHP problems in your application, but you should check the worker settings, here is an example:
<IfModule worker.c>
  StartServers           3
  MaxClients           500
  MinSpareThreads       75
  MaxSpareThreads      250 
  ThreadsPerChild       25
  MaxRequestsPerChild  300
</IfModule>

You start 3 processes, each containing 25 threads (so 3*25=75 parallel requests available by default), you allow 75 threads doing nothing, as soon as one thread is used a new process is forked, adding 25 more threads. And when you have more than 250 threads doing nothing (10 processes) some process are killed. You must adjust theses settings with your memory. Here you allow 500 parallel process (that's 20 process of 25 threads). Your usage is maybe more: 
<IfModule worker.c>
  StartServers           2
  MaxClients           250
  MinSpareThreads       50
  MaxSpareThreads      150 
  ThreadsPerChild       25
  MaxRequestsPerChild  300
</IfModule>

I don't know why the server thinks your root is at /app but this error occurs because of the permission of the public/ directory from which Heroku is supposed to serve your application.

While you are at it, check your Procfile make sure it is spelled correctly and starts with an uppercase P.

46,title:Apache 2.4.x manual build and install on RHEL 6.4,"description:OS: Red Hat Enterprise Linux Server release 6.4 (Santiago)
The current yum installation of apache on this OS is 2.2.15. I require the latest 2.4.x branch so have gone about installing it manually. I have noted the complete procedure I undertook, including unpacking apr and apr-util sources into the apache sources beforehand, but I guess the following is the most important part of the procedure:


This seems to have gone fine until I attempt to start the httpd service. It seems that every module include in httpd.conf fails with a message similar to this one for mod_rewrite:

I've gone right through the list of enabled modules in httpd.conf and commented them out one at a time. All trigger an error as above, however the ""undefined symbol: value"" is often different (so not always ap_global_mutex_create).
Am I missing a step? Although I find a some portion of that error on Google, most of the solutions centre around the .so files not being reachable. That doesn't seem to be an issue here and the modules are present in /etc/http/modules.","
You have the correct procedure but it's incomplete. 
After the installation you have to enable SSL in httpd.conf. and generate server.crt and server.key file.
Below the complete procedure : 
1. Download Apache
cd /usr/src
wget http://www.apache.org/dist/httpd/httpd-2.4.23.tar.gz
tar xvf httpd-2.4.23.tar.gz

2. Download APR and APR-Util
cd /usr/src
wget -c http://mirror.cogentco.com/pub/apache/apr/apr-1.5.2.tar.gz
wget -c http://mirror.cogentco.com/pub/apache/apr/apr-util-1.5.4.tar.gz
tar xvf apr-1.5.2.tar.gz
tar xvf apr-util-1.5.4.tar.gz

Now put the APR and APR-Util you downloaded into your apache source files.
mv apr-1.5.2 /usr/src/httpd-2.4.23/srclib/apr
mv apr-util-1.5.4 /usr/src/httpd-2.4.23/srclib/apr-util

3.Compile
cd /usr/src/httpd-2.4.23
./configure --enable-so --enable-ssl --with-mpm=prefork --with-included-apr --with-included-apr-util
make
make install

As you can see in the ./configure command we specify command line options to include apr and apr-utils.
4. Enable SSL in httpd.conf
Apache configuration file httpd.conf is located under /usr/local/apache2/conf.
nano /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

Uncomment the httpd-ssl.conf Include line and the LoadModule ssl_module line in the /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf file :
# LoadModule ssl_module modules/mod_ssl.so
# Include conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf

View the httpd-ssl.conf to review all the default SSL configurations. For most cases, you don闂備胶鍋ㄩ崕鏌ユ ?need to modify anything in this file.
nano /usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf

The SSL certificate and key are required before we start the Apache. The server.crt and server.key file mentioned in the httpd-ssl.conf needs to be created before we move forward.
cd /usr/local/apache2/conf/extra
egrep 'server.crt|server.key' httpd-ssl.conf

SSLCertificateFile ""/usr/local/apache2/conf/server.crt""
SSLCertificateKeyFile ""/usr/local/apache2/conf/server.key""

5. Generate server.crt and server.key file
First, Generate the server.key using openssl.
cd /usr/src
openssl genrsa -des3 -out server.key 1024

The above command will ask for the password. Make sure to remember this password. You need this while starting your Apache later.
Next, generate a certificate request file (server.csr) using the above server.key file.
openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr

Finally, generate a self signed ssl certificate (server.crt) using the above server.key and server.csr file.
openssl x509 -req -days 365 -in server.csr -signkey server.key -out server.crt

Copy the server.key and server.crt file to appropriate Apache configuration directory location.
cp server.key /usr/local/apache2/conf/
cp server.crt /usr/local/apache2/conf/

6. Start Apache
/usr/local/apache2/bin/apachectl start

If you are getting the below error message : 
AH00526: Syntax error on line 51 of /usr/local/apache2/conf/extra/httpd-ssl.conf:
Invalid command 'SSLCipherSuite', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration

Make sure to uncomment the line shown below in httpd.conf : 
vi /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

# LoadModule socache_shmcb_module modules/mod_socache_shmcb.so

Finally, this will prompt you to enter the password for your private key before starting up the apache.
Verify that the Apache httpd process is running in the background.
ps -ef | grep http

You should see something like that : 
root    29529 1     0 13:08 ? 00:00:00 /usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd -k start
antoine 29530 29529 0 13:08 ? 00:00:00 /usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd -k start
antoine 29531 29529 0 13:08 ? 00:00:00 /usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd -k start
antoine 29532 29529 0 13:08 ? 00:00:00 /usr/local/apache2/bin/httpd -k start
root    29616 18260 0 13:09 pts/0 00:00:00 grep http

By default Apache SSL runs on 443 port. Open a web browser and verify that you can access your Apache using https://{your-ip-address}

I have my web app projects located in a folder in /media/disk1/Projects. I want to serve them using an Apache virtualhost at http://lab/.
This is how I set up my virtual host:
1. Copied /etc/apache2/sites-available/default to /etc/apache2/sites-available/lab
2. Edited /etc/apache2/sites-available/lab to the following:

3. Added 127.0.0.1 lab to my /etc/hosts:

4. Accessed http://lab only to get 500 Internal Server Error
All the subfolder permissions are set to drwxrwxrwx 
But my http://lab/phpmyadmin works.
Help me resolve. Thanks.","

So I went ahead and digged up lucene-analyzers-common.jar and explicitly added it in my solrconfig.xml, like so:

I hate so trivial solutions. Finally I've found the problem and solution by myself. Leaving it here for reference for others with some pre-history.
FastCGI configuration files were taken from internet when first configuring FastCGI as I haven't used it before. Tutorials showing FastCGI configuration contained the line php_value[soap.wsdl_cache_dir]  = /var/lib/php/wsdlcache. I became really interested what is SOAP as I don't use it on the websites that I run on this server and this curiosity brought me the solution. Actually I don't need SOAP and simply removing that line would fix the problem I guess, but I've decided to leave it there and found out that I needed simply to install php-soap.
yum install php-soap

I've read numerous tutorial sites on how to install this plugin, and most of them offer an update site. Unfortunately, my Eclipse is not finding any of the repositories that are supposedly at the URL's I've been given. Here are some of the one's I've tried:

Sadly, all of these haven't proven useful yet, so I'm starting to think that perhaps a certain setting is off or missing within Eclipse itself that is preventing it from finding these repositories. Sometimes, though, it tells me that it is simply unable to read a repository. For example, Eclipse spat out this error a few times when trying to use http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/sites/m2e/:

When this happens, it seems as though its ""finding"" the repository, but it just can't read it... As I've said, I've followed a handful of instructions to downloading the plugin, and none have worked thanks to this initial step. Any ideas?","
m2eclipse has moved from sonatype to eclipse.  
The correct update site is http://download.eclipse.org/technology/m2e/releases/
If this is not working, one possibility is you have an older version of Eclipse (< 3.6).  The other - if you see timeout related errors - could be that you are behind a proxy server.

Even though you have the two sites split up and using two different php.ini files, CRON will still use whichever php.ini file the PHP-CLI is configured to use.  So, to figure out which php.ini CRON is using, this is the command to use:
php -i | grep php.ini

If PHP-CLI happens to be using a php.ini file that you didn't expect it to be using (such as /usr/local/lib/php.ini) then that will be the key to figuring out why you're seeing Xdebug errors in the logs.  
It turns out that the /usr/local/lib/php.ini file had these two values set:
extension_dir = ""/usr/local/lib/php/extensions/no-debug-non-zts-20090626""
zend_extension = ""xdebug.so""

That was causing the error from the php script that was run by CRON (i.e. PHP-CLI) because zend_extensions need the full path to the module.  This is also stated in the Xdebug documentation: http://xdebug.org/docs/install
So, to get rid of the error, just comment out that line (or just remove it).  You could also comment out or remove the extension_dir line as long as you are not loading any other modules such as:

67,title:Downtime when reloading mod_wsgi daemon?,"description:I'm running a Django application on Apache with mod_wsgi. Will there be any downtime during an upgrade?
Mod_wsgi is running in daemon mode, so I can reload my code by touching the .wsgi script file, as described in the ""ReloadingSourceCode"" document: http://code.google.com/p/modwsgi/wiki/ReloadingSourceCode. Presumably, that reload requires some non-zero amount of time. What happens if a request comes in during the reload? Will Apache queue the request and then complete it once the wsgi daemon is ready?
The documentation includes the following statement:

To me, that suggests that Apache will gracefully handle every request, but I thought I would ask to be sure. My app isn't critical (a little downtime wouldn't be disastrous) so the question is mostly academic.
Thank you.","
In daemon mode there is no concept of a graceful restart when WSGI script file is touched to force a download. That is, unlike Apache itself, which will start new Apache server child processes while waiting for old processes to finish up with current requests, for mod_wsgi daemon processes, the existing process must exit before a new one starts up.
The consequences of this are that mod_wsgi can't wait indefinitely for current requests to complete. If it did, then there is a risk that if all daemon processes are tied up waiting for current requests to finish, that clients would see a noticeable delay in being handled.
At the other end of the scale however, the daemon process can't be immediately killed as that would cause current requests to be interrupted.
A middle ground therefore exists. The daemon process will wait for requests to finish before exiting, but if they haven't completed within the shutdown period, then the daemon process will be forcibly quit and the active requests will be interrupted.
The period of this shutdown timeout defaults to 5 seconds. It can be overridden using the shutdown-timeout option to WSGIDaemonProcess directive, but due consideration should be given to the effects of changing it.
Thus, in respect of this specific issue, if you have long running requests still active when the first request comes in after you touched the WSGI script file, there is the risk that the active long requests will be interrupted.
The next notable thing you may see is that even if there are no long running requests and processes shutdown promptly, then it is still necessary to load up the WSGI application again within the new process. The time this takes will be seen as a delay in handling the request. How big that delay is will depend on the framework and your application. The worst offender as far as time taken to start up that I know of is TurboGears. Django somewhat better and the best as far as quick start up times being lightweight micro frameworks such as Flask.
Do note that any new requests which come in while these shutdown and startup delays occur should not be lost. This is because the HTTP listener socket has a certain depth and connections queue up in that waiting to be accepted. If the number of requests arriving is huge though and that queue fills up, then you will start to see connection refused errors in the browser.
","So, if you are using Django in daemon mode and needed to change your 'settings.py' file, once you have made the required change, also touch the script file containing the WSGI application entry point. Having done that, on the next request the process will be restarted and your Django application reloaded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
73,title:Can I Override PHP Setting in htaccess When Using PHP-FPM?,"description:My vhost looks like this:

I'm trying to add php_value lines to my .htaccess file. As soon as I do, I get 500 errors, and this in my Apache's errors log:

So, the question: Is there any way to override php.ini settings via .htaccess, when using PHP-FPM?
tia.","
As others already pointed out, no, you can't override settings via .htaccess when using PHP-FPM.
But there seems to be a similar mechanism from PHP, named .user.ini files.

Since PHP 5.3.0, PHP includes support for configuration INI files on a per-directory basis. These files are processed only by the CGI/FastCGI SAPI. This functionality obsoletes the PECL htscanner extension. If you are using Apache, use .htaccess files for the same effect.
In addition to the main php.ini file, PHP scans for INI files in each directory, starting with the directory of the requested PHP file, and working its way up to the current document root (as set in $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT']). In case the PHP file is outside the document root, only its directory is scanned.
Only INI settings with the modes PHP_INI_PERDIR and PHP_INI_USER will be recognized in .user.ini-style INI files.

And in a comment below

""If you are using Apache, use .htaccess files for the same effect.""
To clarify, this applies only to Apache module mode. If you put php directives in .htaccess on an Apache CGI/FastCGI server, this will bomb the server out with a 500 error.

So you can create .user.ini files analogue to .htaccess, but in ini style format.

How do I fix this? It's ok to create new entry if i choose top class.","
There are a number of issues with that tutorial(spelling, UI looks different, etc) but i have managed to import the sample data and add a new entry.
your error occurs for this reason: com contains more than one STRUCTURAL ObjectClass. this is occurring because domain and organizationalPerson are both structural and will not work together, try removing domain. For more info, see LDAP objectClasses
To import the captain-hook-hierarchy.ldif you need to create a new partition first. The tutorial is inconsistent with naming conventions and is the cause of your error. 
Create a new partition:
ID:SevenSeas
Suffix: o=sevenSeas

The error you get is because of the ,dc=com from the tutorial. if you open the .ldif you'll see there is no reference to ,dc=com.
Next uncheck the Auto-generate context entry from suffix DN checkbox. it doesnt create the appropriate attributes for the example. Then add these attributes:
o: sevenSeas
objectClass: top
objectClass: organization
description: The context entry for suffix o=sevenSeas

Save the config.ldif file and restart the server. Then import  captain-hook-hierarchy.ldif.
The directory should populate and to add new entries just right-click on a group and Add new entry.
Hope this helps!

Anyone have any suggestions for things to look at or try?  We're heading to tcpdump next.
UPDATE 10/21/08: Still haven't figured this out. Seeing only a very small number of these under load.  The answers below haven't provided any magical answers...yet. :)","
Just to add some specific settings, I had a similar setup (with Apache 2.0.63 reverse proxying onto Tomcat 5.0.27).
For certain URLs the Tomcat server could take perhaps 20 minutes to return a page.
I ended up modifying the following settings in the Apache configuration file to prevent it from timing out with its proxy operation (with a large over-spill factor in case Tomcat took longer to return a page):
Timeout 5400
ProxyTimeout 5400


Some backgound
ProxyTimeout alone wasn't enough. Looking at the documentation for Timeout I'm guessing (I'm not sure) that this is because while Apache is waiting for a response from Tomcat, there is no traffic flowing between Apache and the Browser (or whatever http client) - and so Apache closes down the connection to the browser.
I found that if I left the Timeout setting at its default (300 seconds), then if the proxied request to Tomcat took longer than 300 seconds to get a response the browser would display a ""502 Proxy Error"" page. I believe this message is generated by Apache, in the knowledge that it's acting as a reverse proxy, before it closes down the connection to the browser (this is my current understanding - it may be flawed).
The proxy error page says:

Proxy Error
The proxy server received an invalid
  response from an upstream server. The
  proxy server could not handle the
  request GET.
Reason: Error reading from remote server

...which suggests that it's the ProxyTimeout setting that's too short, while investigation shows that Apache's Timeout setting (timeout between Apache and the client) that also influences this.
","Bad Gateway!

For 500 Internal Server Error i have tried following code :

But it shows me a blank page.
How can i show the error in Apache's default format?
Please guide..","
You could just copy the Apache error documents into your web root (or symlink them in) and use header() to set the error codes and with those documents as output. That's probably best unless you have a compelling reason not to. But in case that won't work for you, there are some alternatives (albeit, hacky alternatives).
For 500, just put a bug in your code.
<?php throw new Exception('Nooooooooooooooo!'); ?>

The PHP script will raise an exception, resulting in a regular Apache 500 error page. (But be aware of the caveat that this will only result in an Apache error if the PHP init setting display_errors is set to 0. In most development configurations, this is not the case. In most production configurations, this is the case. If you don't know your production server's setting, you'll have to just test this to see if it works.)
For 404, I think the best you can do is redirect to a non-existent page. It's not exactly the same thing, but might do for your purposes.
<?php header(""Location: /i-dont-think-therefore-i-am-not""); ?>

In most browsers, the users won't actually see the redirect, they will just get silently and quickly redirected to a non-existent page, resulting in a regular Apache 404 error. Of course, the url will have changed and some users might notice that. If that's not acceptable, you can perhaps achieve similar results using Apache mod_rewrite to rewrite the url backend to a non-existent location.
To respond to several comments: Setting the response code via header() (or some other way) will not result in the standard Apache error document. It will simply return that response code with your own output. This is intentional behavior, designed so that you can have custom error documents, or otherwise set response codes as the HTTP spec dictates on any request. If you want the Apache error documents, you have to either forge them (as per my initial suggestion of simply copying the error documents to your web root), or you'll have to trick Apache into returning them (as per my backup suggestion).

My svn administrator user can do at the same local PC as the troubled user that commit.
UPPERCASE/lowercase URL isn't the problem, i've checked
NTLM and Active Directory aren't the problem either since he has access to the other repo with the same permission file.
Other users of the same repo are experimenting the same problem. While I can still do the commit at their local PCs. (just as if they had no writing permission)

Here are the Apache logs:
Apache error.log

Apache access.log

svn_activity.log

From the svn_activity.log I can deduce Apache catches and bounces the access, given that there is no foobar access at time-frame exposed previously.
So, hoping that the data i've collected is useful to solve this... any ideas?","
I've found it!
Ok here's the answer:
What was the problem:
My users check out a Repo in the directory /svn/myDir/MYREPO
Apache knows that he has to translate MYREPO to a lowercase directory so when you check out or do any read operation this was working just fine.
But when the users did try to do the commit operation Apache changes
somehow the order of the operations he has to do to fulfill the users request so, first accepts the write operation and tries to write, and then changes to lowercase.
Again, it tries to write to the /svn/myDir/MYREPO, the issue is that:

permissions to the repo where set to myrepo and not MYREPO
the actual repo is myrepo and not MYREPO

So... MYREPO does not exist! myrepo does. That's why it throws that error:

ACCESS DENIED because there is no permission written for MYREPO.
And It does recognize the repo in the read way because apache understands what you are asking for and translates.

But for writing first works with it and after that takes a moment to understand what is he doing. And the exception comes previous to the understanding so Apache never get's there.
How to solve it:
This is the simplest thing:

Go to the checked out Repo
Do a Relocate from http://YourServer/svn/myDir/MYREPO to http://YourServer/svn/myDir/myrepo

My recommendation:
My recommendation for svn-administrators and users from now on, is do
EVERITHING LOWERCASE... sorry, I correct myself:
everything lowercase!

The client certificate is used in the SSL connection to verify the identity of the user. The verification is done with public key cryptography, e.g. the client signs something with its private key and the signature can be verified with the public key. And because the private key is only known to the client but the public key to everybody (it is included in the certificate), only the client can sign but everybody can verify the signature and thus it is proven that the signed text comes from the client. 
If you use the apache as a proxy which requests a client certificate it will receive the certificate which contains the client public key and it will be able to verify the signature of the client. But it has no access to the clients private key and thus it will not be able to create another https connection with the clients original certificate. All it can do is to verify the clients certificate and then forward the important information as HTTP headers to the upstream server. 
It looks like you attempt to put the information from the clients certificate inside HTTP header, but that your upstream server requires more, e.g. it requires the clients certificate which you cannot offer (error message: ""..downstream server wanted client certificate..""). Therefore you need to change the upstream server, so that it accepts connection without client certificate and reads the authorization information from the HTTP-Headers you've inserted in the proxy.

The URL-path in the argument of the ErrorDocument directive is always relative to the DocumentRoot. 
However, you can work around this using the mod_rewrite module.

Make sure the 404.php does actually emit a 404 response header!
I haven't tested it, but this should get you started. Also note that using the ErrorDocument directive is always preferable to this, and asking where the site will reside relative to DocumentRoot would be sensible, so you'd be able to write

There is something called a RewriteMap.
You can call an executable script that will return the URL to rewrite to.
Check this article for more information and examples (in Perl, but are totally applicable to any other language):
http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/apache/2005/04/28/apacheckbk.html
Summary of caveats:

Must run a read STDIN loop (ie, don't exit after receiving an URL)
Must print the URL to rewrite to WITH a trailing newline
Must be readable and executable by the user Apache runs as

This is the way to create the map
RewriteMap fixurl prg:/usr/local/scripts/fixit.php

And now we can use it in a RewriteRule:
RewriteEngine On
RewriteRule (.*) ${fixurl:$1} 

EDIT: About the Internal Server Error. The most probable cause is what Gumbo mentions, RewriteMap cannot be used in .htaccess, sadly. You can use it in a RewriteRule in .htaccess, but can only create it in server config or virtual host config. To be certain, check the error log.
So, the only PHP / .htaccess only solution would be to rewrite everything to a certain PHP program which does the checking and redirects using the Location header. Something like:
RewriteRule (.*) proxy.php?args=$1 [QSA]

Then, in proxy.php
<?php
      $url = get_proper_destination($QUERY_STRING); #args will have the URI path, 
                                                    #and, via QSA you will have

99,title:Symfony - name based virtual servers on localhost - is this possible?,"description:I am rapidly coming to the conclusion that this is not feasible, although for some reason, people - most likely who have not implemented the 'advice' they give, seem to think this is possible.
The scenario is quite straightforward. I am developing symfony websites on my local dev machine, running Ubuntu 10.0.4 LTS. I want to be able to run and test multiple sites locally.
Assuming I have the following sites:

site1.localhost
site2.localhost
site3.localhost

Following the documentation here, here and here (none of which work for me), I have done the following:
A. I modified my /etc/hosts file with the first entry to be:

B. I modified my /etc/apache2/ports.conf file (first lines) as follows:

C. I have created configuration sites for each of the websites (site1.localhost and site2.localhost). Each configuration is a separate file in /etc/apache2/sites-available
One such configuration file (for site1.localhost) in /etc/apache2/sites-available/site1 looks like this:

D. I have disabled the default apache site by using (it kept showing up instead)
E. Since I can't enable all the sites I enable to work (like the documentation links above 
purport), I have settled for enabling one site at a time, so that Apache dosen't get its confused as to which site to run. When I need to run another site, I disable the current one and enable the one I want to. This is (obviously?) far from ideal - but even this setup is not working - for the reasons listed below.
i). When I restart Apache, I get the following warning:

ii). when I navigate to http://site1.localhost
I get the following error message in FF:  

iii). My apache related errors are appearing in /var/log/apachche2/other_vosts.log

My questions are:

Can Apache be setup to handle multiple virtual hosts on localhost? Afterall, all examples I have seen so far involve setting Apache with public facing ip addresses
If Apache can indeed handle multiple sites on localhost, which of the steps above am I doing incorrectly?. AFAICT, I have followed the documentation to the letter.","
Yes, you can have several VirtualHosts, on your local machine -- It's exactly the same as when working on a remote server, except the IP address and domain-name are not the same.
What I generally do is :
Edit the hosts file
To add the new domain-names that I want served from my local computer.
For example, I would add :
127.0.0.1       tests
127.0.0.1       blog

And so on, with one line for each domain-name I want.

Add new VirtualHosts to Apache's configuration
Then, I add new VirtualHosts to Apache's configuration.
First site : tests
For example, for my tests domain-name, I would use :
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName tests
        DocumentRoot /home/squale/developpement/tests
        <Directory /home/squale/developpement/tests>
                AllowOverride All
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                allow from all
        </Directory>
        ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
</VirtualHost>

A couple of things to note here :

The VirtualHost  is on *:80

So, it'll listen to any address

The mapping to the domain-name is made by the ServerName directive


Of course, up to you to make sure that this VirtualHost is seen by Apache -- either by placing it's configuration in a loaded file (not recommended), or by :

Placing that configuration in a new file in /etc/apache2/sites-available/
Using a2ensite to enable the site


Which will create a symbolic-link in /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/, pointing to your new configuration file.



Second site : blog
And here the configuration I'd use for a second domain-name, that correspond to blog :
<VirtualHost *:80>
        ServerName blog
        DocumentRoot /home/squale/developpement/blog.pascal-martin.fr/www
        <Directory /home/squale/developpement/blog.pascal-martin.fr/www>
                AllowOverride All
                Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
                allow from all
        </Directory>
        ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/error.log
</VirtualHost>

It's basically exactly the same thing ; only two differences :

The ServerName directive correspond to my second domain-name -- of course
And the DocumentRoot is not the same


Other files ?
I don't really change anything else to Apache's default configuration (I'm on Ubuntu, if that matters).
For example, I don't change anything in the ports.conf file : I still have the default NameVirtualHost and Listen directives :
NameVirtualHost *:80
Listen 80

Only important modifications I do are to enable some modules, like rewrite, expires, ... But that's not much related to your VirtualHosts problem ;-)

Results ?
If I open my browser and go to http://tests/, I get the things I would expect from my tests domain -- a list of directories and files, here.
And if I open my browser and go to http://blog/, I get the development instance of my blog -- well, and error page, saying that I forgot to set up the database ^^

Upgrade your Subversion client to the latest version.

Outdated answer:
ON THE CLIENT MACHINE! Open %APPDATA%\Subversion\servers in a text editor and add the line http-bulk-updates = yes, save the file and see if it helps.
If it helps, you'd better configure Apache HTTP Server's httpd.conf with SVNAllowBulkUpdates prefer directive so that all Subversion 1.8 clients could connect without any errors.
If there are more than just you who get this error in your organization and adjusting server's configuration is still unacceptable, you can change the setting http-bulk-updates = yes via Windows Registry so adjusting this on all affected machines can be done via AD Group Policy.
Read more info in Apache Subversion 1.8 Release Notes.
P.S.: faulty network hardware / firewall / antivirus is still the root cause here. The above is just a workaround to revert to the behavior of Subversion 1.7 and older client with neon network library. BTW, I guess that the installed antivirus is NOD32 or BitDefender.

108,"title:OpenSSL not working on Windows, errors 0x02001003 0x2006D080 0x0E064002","description:Problem: OpenSSL is not working in my Windows environment. OpenSSL repeatedly reports errors 0x02001003, 0x2006D080 and 0x0E064002.
Environment:

What I've Attempted:

Installation Instructions http://www.php.net/manual/en/openssl.installation.php
PHP.ini extension=php_openssl.dll
Openssl.cnf E:\wamp\php\extras\openssl.cnf

Rebooted

----OpenSSL Library Version OpenSSL 1.0.1e 11 Feb 2013
----OpenSSL Header Version  OpenSSL 0.9.8y 5 Feb 2013  
With and without specifying config in configargs
With and without specifying <Directory E:\wamp\php\extras> in apache config
Copied openssl.cnf to virtualhost public_html, pointed to that and still get same errors
Nothing logged in error_log
Researched: I've spent the last 2 days researching this, surprised there isn't more info on it so I'm posting here. Seems to be problem with OpenSSL config or apache/php not reading config properly.

Code: 

Results:

OpenSSL Manually:

EDIT:

Thanks to @Gordon I can now see open_ssl errors using openssl_error_string
Completely uninstall EasyPHP. Manually installed stable versions of PHP/Apache. Same results! Definitely something I'm doing wrong with implementing openssl on windows.
OpenSSL Manually section... additional error info

FINAL THOUGHTS:
I set up a linux box and I'm getting the same errors. After some playing around I see that even though it's throwing errors at the openssl_pkey_new it does eventually create my test p12 file. Long story short, the errors are misleading and it has to deal more with how you are using openssl functions not so much server-side configuration.
Final code:

Close away.
A year later...
So I found myself doing this again a year later, and regardless of whatever PATH variables I set on the computer or during the script execution, it kept erroring about file not found. I was able to resolve it by passing in the config parameter in the config_args array in openssl_pkey_new. Here is a function that tests the ability to successfully use OpenSSL:","
The code below works as expected. BUT if you run openssl_error_string() after the openssl methods it shows error:0E06D06C:configuration file routines:NCONF_get_string:no value which is some notice I have not been able to find documentation on.
Further note that according to http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.openssl-error-string.php you could be seeing mis-leading errors as error messages are queued:

Be careful when using this function to check errors, as it seems to read from a buffer of > errors, which could include errors from another script or process that was using openssl > functions. (I was surprised to find it returing error messages before I had called any > openssl_* functions)

You write:

When attempting to use ldap_connect(), I get this error:
Fatal error: Call to undefined function ldap_connect()

You get this error because the function ldap_connect婵☆偅婢樼€电cs is not defined. You can not call an undefined function in PHP, that's why you see the fatal error.
To get that function defined, you need to load a PHP module/extension called LDAP. It comes with installation intructions. You wrote:

I've recompiled php with the LDAP apache module enabled.

If you recompile PHP, ensure you enable LDAP, see:

You will need to use the --with-ldap[=DIR] configuration option when compiling PHP to enable LDAP support. DIR is the LDAP base install directory.

However, normally it's enough to just install what you need via the package manager, e.g. try:
# yum install php-ldap

If it's not enough and you actually need to edit your PHP configuration (not always necessary), do it:
$ vi /etc/php.ini

add extension=ldap.so

# service httpd restart

I hope this is helpful. Take care that .dll is windows only.

In the ci213/application/controllers and views directories I have a simple site.php controller and test.php view. I'm out of ideas as to why this site wont load. Anyone have suggestions on what I could look for next? Maybe logging it's working properly? If I could get better log errors I could have more to work with.
I figured it has to be something with codeigniter since I have an index.php and index.html at apaches root (/var/www) and also an index2.php at the sites root (/var/www/vhosts/srp-local/htdocs), when I go to localhost/index.(php|html) or srp-local/index2.php the pages load and display properly so php and apache are working.

Update: I checked the account/password and access for the database everything was working. The issue was the php mysql driver was not installed. This is my first time really using an Ubuntu system and I thought that the mysql driver would be installed with the default php package, which I was incorrect about.
After installing php5-mysqlnd and enabling the database library in CI's autoload everything works properly now. The fact that I was not getting any errors is really making me consider changing frameworks.

Try executing the call manually yourself in your browser (its the same thing) and see what gets returned.  If nothing gets returned and you get a 500 internal server error, you need to then review your logs and see whats causing this error to happen.

After being prompted by abarnert I realized that it wasn't a problem in the larger structure of Flask and Apache but simply with the structure of my import. So my solution that got it working was to make sure first that I did
from web_tool import web_tool as application

Because my project structure looks like
/path/web_tool/src/web_tool/
    web_tool.py
    web_tool.wsgi

I think naming the folder the same as the main python script the same confused but then I got it straight. Now the above import still didn't work because I got a module error but what did work was:
from web_tool import web_tool
application = web_tool.app

I didn't see this structure anywhere else online or in any other SO answers but that is probably because of my particular project structure.

If you flip the signature number round, you'll see the bytes of the start of your file:

The first two bytes look like a Unicode BOM, 0xFEFF means 16 bit little endian. You then have some low control bytes, the hex codes for 0 then 258 then 2, so maybe it isn't a text file after all.
That file really isn't an OLE2 file, and POI is right to give you the error. I don't know what it is, but I'm guessing that perhaps it might be part of an OLE2 file without it's outer OLE2 wrapper? If you can open it with office, do a save-as and POI should be fine to open that. As it stands, that header isn't an OLE2 file header so POI can't open it for you.

136,title:FastCGI: aborted: select() failed,"description:I have VPS server (CentOS 6.5) running Apache 2.2.4 and PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager).
2-3 times a day I get following errors in error_log:

And as a result apache not always stops, sometimes only main process stops and worker processes still run which prevents me even to restart apache as it's still listening on port 80, but without main process and pid file.
I saw somebody mention to update to mod_fastcgi 2.4.7 (patched) which fixes that bug, but unfortunately RHEL/CentOS doesn't have that updates, so that is not an option for me. (Apache PHP5-FPM connection reset by peer)
Also there was thread on google answers that increasing value of --idle-timeout in fastcgi.conf can solve the issue, but I don't see the reason.
Any solutions for this problem, please?","
Increasing -idle-timeout (just one dash in front though ^^) is indeed the solution. A complete explanation on this is given here, but I'll try to explain it:
PHP has it's own timeout, set in max_execution_time. If running it using mod_php, this setting tells PHP to quit working on a script after x seconds.
Next: the FPM process manager has another one, request_terminate_timeoutset in the pool configuration. This one limits / overrides max_execution_time. 
That's it for the pure PHP-side part. If you're using PHP-FPM and FastCGI, PHP is started in its own process. The internal timeouts still apply. FastCGI however has its own timeout (which isn't needed for PHP, but how should fastCGI now PHP has its own?), that makes sure the webserver doesn't freeze if some CGI process does (or just works for a very long time). 
The problem is: FastCGI just kills the IO stream between PHP and Apache, giving PHP no chance to properly shut down. Data that has already been received by FastCGI is still handed over to Apache - if it's incomplete, it'll raise an error (the one you see about incomplete headers). In addition to that, the PHP processes stay there, running in a zombie-like state, unusable because there IO stream is now dead. You may have to kill them manually or wait until PHP-FPM hopefully does (depending on process manager settings). The other errors you're getting are generated by PHP for this exact reason: Pipe was closed, Apache ""disappeared"" on the other end.
So: Make sure FastCGIs timeout is higher (by at least one second) than request_terminate_timeout, and this one is higher by at least another second than the highest value you use in max_execution_time.
Note that the latter can be changed using ini_set, so make sure to remember what values do work and what don't - or set it using php_admin_value in your FPM pool configuration, so it cannot be changed inside individual scripts (see the documentation). Not because it's necessary (request_terminate_timeout will terminate PHP children properly as long as it'S lower than the FastCGI timeout), but because your scripts can detect the timeout properly if setting max_execution_time fails, while they will asusme it worked if they can override it (there is no way to read request_terminate_timeout from inside PHP scripts).
You can change all values for each pool separately:

max_execution_time via php_value/php_admin_value inside the pool config
request_terminate_timeout directly inside the pool config
FastCGIs -idle-timeout in the Apache config, where each pool has to be added separately anyway:
FastCgiExternalServer /usr/lib/cgi-bin/external.php5.www -socket /var/run/php5-fpm/www.sock -pass-header Authorization -idle-timeout 310  -flush
(paths may be different of course, this is just a quote from my config, but I'd recommend the pass-header for Authorization, although not related to this problem).

P.S: I have tried restarting Apache every time!","
If you are trying to intercept 500 errors from PHP in apache using mod_php with SetHandler (A very common way), then the answer is that you can't. To the best of my knowledge it's not a supported feature.
However there are ways such as using PHP via it's FastCGI interface (PHP-FPM) and the Apache proxy module to achieve what you require.
First, you may need to ensure that mod_proxy and proxy_fcgi_module are installed on your server and enabled in the Apache config like so:
LoadModule proxy_module modules/mod_proxy.so
LoadModule proxy_fcgi_module modules/mod_proxy_fcgi.so

Also ensure that PHP-FPM is installed and running as a service, the default port it uses is 9000.
Then replace your apache PHP configuration (possibly in /etc/httpd/conf.d/php.conf) with the following.
ProxyPassMatch ^/(.*\.php(/.*)?)$ fcgi://127.0.0.1:9000/var/www/html/$1
DirectoryIndex /index.php index.php

This will mean that you are now using the Apache Proxy module to send traffic to PHP. It is possible to instruct Apache to intercept error responses from the proxy module and use custom error handlers with the following in your VirtualHost section.

140,"title:""End of script output before headers"" in Apache + PHP","description:UPDATE: This issue was caused by the server request timing out before the script completed.*
I have legacy code running on a shared LAMP host (nearlyfreespeech.net), and I recently added a new script that refuses to work in production.
My apache error logs show the message End of script output before headers: switch.php, and I get 500 statuses when trying to trigger the script with a web client.
According to other StackOverflow posts, this error message is usually due to a file permissions error. However, the file permissions on the new script are the same as all the others.
Here are the relevant file permissions:

With these include() heirarchies:

switch.php -> auth/cloudsaves.php (works)
switch.php -> auth/cloudsaves.2.php <- auth/rumpus_migration.php (does not work)

All requests are for switch.php and include a parameter value causing either auth/cloudsaves.php or auth/cloudsaves.2.php to be included.
In my local test environment everything works just fine. In production when I use the parameter that causes switch.php to include the cloudsaves.2.php script I get the error.
I've tried changing the group and permissions on rumpus_migration.php and cloudsaves.2.php to exactly match other files that are properly being included by the parent switch.php script, always with the same outcome. This new script (cloudsaves.2.php) is the only script included by switch.php that itself includes another script.
I'm not familiar with Apache or PHP, and the production code is on a shared host where I have extremely limited admin access. The fact that the code works locally but not in production makes it seem that a permissions issue is a likely culprit, but I don't know how to move forward since none of the working permissions options seem to fix it.","
The issue was that the request was timing out before the script completed, due to a long-running database query.
So that generic End of script output before headers error can be caused by server timeouts as well as file permissions issues.

That's not how you get Subversion to work with Apache httpd if that's what you're trying to do. You need the mod_dav and mod_dav_svn modules for Apache. You might have to recompile Apache to get these.
Once you get mod_dav and mod_dav_svn installed, you need to configure your httpd.conf file (or put a configuration file under your httpd's conf.d depending how it's configured on your system) for it to work.
In the end, it's not all that difficult. Most Apache installations have mod_dav and mod_dav_svn added in, and you can see if your http.conf file is configured correctly. The on line Subversion manual will have everything you need to get it working.

svn: Could not use external editor to fetch log message; consider setting the
  $SVN_EDITOR environment variable or using the --message (-m) or --file (-F) options
  svn: None of the environment variables SVN_EDITOR, VISUAL or EDITOR are set, and no
  'editor-cmd' run-time configuration option was found

Read the message. It says Could not use external editor because you didn't specify one. Again the Subversion on line manual explains it in detail. 
Basically, when you commit a change in Subversion, you need to create a commit message. This can be done in two ways:

You use the -m option like svn commit -m ""This is my commit message"".
You set the variables SVN_EDITOR, VISUAL, or EDITOR to the name of the program you want to use. For example, in Windows, you'd say C:> set EDITOR=notepad.exe. On Unix, you'd say something like $ export EDITOR=vi. Subversion first checks the value of the SVN_EDITOR variable, then VISUAL, then EDITOR. If none of them are set, it gives you the error you saw.

Why did you get it on the svn mkdir command?
Because you use the URL form of the command, it will make the directory, then commit the change, thus the need for a commit message. This should work:
svn mkdir -m""Adding the site directory to my repository"" file:///httpdocs/svn/site

Now, you need to move your repository out of your HTTPDOCs directory. That's a very bad thing to have because it hurts your web server.
If you don't want to use the file:// protocol, you can use svnserve. This is a built-in Subversion repository server and uses the svn:// protocol. Observe:
$ svnadmin create my_repos   #Creates the repository
$ vi my_repos/conf/svnserve.conf  #See footnote 1 below
$ vi my_repos/conf/passwd         #See footnote 1 below
$ svnserve -r my_repos -d
$ svn mkdir -m ""Making basic directory layout svn://localhost/trunk \
> svn://localhost/tags svn://localhost/branches
$ export SVN_EDITOR=""vi""

Your repository also becomes accessible to all the machines on your network too. Using svnserve is much simpler than Apache httpd, but there are a few issues:

You can't run multiple instances of svnserve since it wants to use port 3690 and it doesn't like to share. With Apache httpd, you can have multiple repositories.
Security setup with svnserve is limited. With Apache, I can use Windows Active directory or LDAP or I can configure it manually.
Some web based subversion repository browsers don't like svnserve.

By the way, if you haven't, go through the Subversion on line manual. It's one of the best manuals I've seen for any open source project.

1 When you setup your repository using svnserve, you need to edit the svnserve.conf file by enabling the line password-db = passed which is about line #20 in the file. Then you have to edit the passed file (located in the same directory) to configure the users and their passwords. Both are very straight forward, but easy to forget, and if you don't do it, you can't commit anything into your repository.

RobB suggested the following:
    
      IPCCommTimeout  7200
    
Which should have worked however due to my godaddy shared hosting it is not allowed. Time to find a new hosting service.","
I'm not sure of the handling with this issue on GoDaddy but the normal resolution would be as follows:
The issue that you are experiencing is due to FastCGI executing a PHP script but it doesn't generate a response within the default IO timeout (120 seconds), which results in the 500 Internal Server Error.
Try editing the default VirtualHost conf file, typically located at /etc/apache2/sites-available/default and add this directive inside the <VirtualHost> context:
<IfModule mod_fcgid.c>
   IPCCommTimeout  7200
</IfModule>

After saving the modification, restart apache2 with this command: sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart.
From what I've been able to determine from GoDaddy is that the maximum time limit is 120 seconds for PHP/FastCGI in shared hosting, which can not be increased by the client.  I would suggest contacting their support for assistance and hopefully their reputation won't serve up and you'll be able to get help.
Update:
Not sure if it will help but you could try changing from FastCGI to PHP5 in your hosting control center (Settings > File Extension > php5).

As stated in the error message:
The 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header contains multiple values '*, https://demo.aonesalons.com', but only one is allowed

Only one entry of Access-Control-Allow-Origin is allowed in a HTTP response. Now since you are using a ProxyPass, it is highly likely that the target application creates it's own header entry for Access-Control-Allow-Origin, which your Apache Server forwards - and in addition to that, it adds the entry containing *, since you specified this in your configuration.
So I guess that in your Angular app you have somewhere something like .header(""Access-Control-Allow-Origin"",""(something)""); if you remove this, your app should be accessible via your Apache server.
Alternatively, you may remove the entry Header always set Access-Control-Allow-Origin ""*"" in your apache config and alter your Angular app in a way that it set the correct header.

The recommended action would be to disable the public display of all PHP errors when you are in production mode.
To do that, edit your php.ini file and set display_errors to 0.  You can still set the error_reporting level to something suitable and all errors will be logged to the error_log file, but the actual errors themselves are not visible to the end user.
Otherwise, there is no way to modify PHP's built in error messages to hide the path.  Doing so would render the error message much less helpful.
See display_errors and error_reporting PHP directives.
EDIT: In the case of the exact error message in your question, you could handle the error (try/catch) and then display a more friendly error that helps you but also doesn't expose your path.  The reason it is displaying like that is because an exception that was thrown was uncaught.

This particular one has an SSL cert installed. I was building my .htaccess up and added a <Files config.php> directive to deny from all so that my config.php file isn't accessible. I realise that storing it outside of the web root is the ideal but I can't in this case.
Normally I would expect that when going to www.domain.com/config.php in a browser that I would get Apache's default 403 Forbidden page. This is what happens on other domains on the same server. But in this case I'm being given a 404 not found error, stating:

I would normally expect this if I was attempting to define custom error documents but in this case, I'm not!
The only thing that makes this domain different to all the others in the same cPanel account is the fact it has an SSL certificate. And this 404 error is the same regardless of navigating using http or https. I've tried clearing cache and still the same.
Can anyone see anything in my .htaccess below that might be causing this?

EDIT: Could it be anything to do with the way cPanel handles primary and addon domains?
In a cPanel account you have a primary domain whose files live under public_html then you define addon domains (or subdomains) whose files live under public_html/addondomain.com/
Would the .htaccess for the primary domain at public_html/.htaccess be affecting/overriding that of addon domains at public_html/addondomain.com/.htaccess?
I know .htaccess does cascade down through directories but is that the case even above a particular domain's DocumentRoot, e.g.: in the case of this addon domain?
EDIT 2: Just for info here are the responses to both HTTP requests, bypassing any caching

You see the 2nd one gets the 301 redirect but it's redirecting to the 403.shtml. So the 403.shtml has already been injected before the rewrite to the www. happens.","
This was not reproducible on a vanilla Apache installation so I started to further interrogate cPanel. So after plenty of mucking around I have tracked down the issue. cPanel does indeed set the ErrorDocument directive for you and it's not very clever at all. Especially when it sets the ErrorDocuments to documents that are visibly identical to the Apache defaults.
It's not obvious where this happens either as the ErrorDocument cPanel screen is blank.
cPanel's httpd.conf is built from quite a few included configs and tucked away there is...
/usr/local/apache/conf/includes/errordocument.conf
...
# 403 - Forbidden
ErrorDocument 403 /403.shtml
So there we go, that's where the 403.shtml is appearing in the request. cPanel's setting the error documents for me. To avoid the confusion of seeing the 404 on the 403 I've set my own 403 error message so at least they are consistent.
I hope this helps someone out!

To verify that a process is listening on port 80, you can use lsof in a terminal window:
$ sudo lsof -iTCP:80 -sTCP:LISTEN
COMMAND   PID USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF NODE NAME
httpd      88 root    4u  IPv6 0xffffff8018804600      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)
httpd      90 _www    4u  IPv6 0xffffff8018804600      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)
httpd   14843 _www    4u  IPv6 0xffffff8018804600      0t0  TCP *:http (LISTEN)

This will verify that you successfully enabled apache.
(I have xcode installed, but I think lsof is part of the normal install)
ADDED:
That confirms that apache is listening on port 80. The next step I would take is to look at the access logs, to see what apache logged when you requested '/' as shown in the error apache returned to your browser. This is what mine shows. Note that the http GET request is shown with the return code 200 (success):
bash-3.2# grep 'GET / ' /private/var/log/apache2/access_log

127.0.0.1 - - [12/Sep/2012:16:49:44 -0400] ""GET / HTTP/1.1"" 200 44

You can also confirm what url your browser is requesting by refreshing your browser window, then confirming that apache logs that new request to the access_log.

175,title:Apache Reverse Proxy changes status code,"description:Background
We have been running an application on JBoss that is exposed to the clients via an Apache Reverse Proxy. We recently introduced ""HTTP 429 Too many requests"" to slow down high velocity requests.

Problem
However, it seems that apache2 changes the HTTP status code from 429 to 500.
Root cause analysis

Confirmed from JBoss that it sends HTTP 429, by bypassing the proxy, and talking to it directly.

Confirmed from /var/log/apache2/access.log, that apache2 gets HTTP 429
 10.0.0.161 - - [16/Jul/2014:07:27:47 +0000] ""POST /the/URL/ HTTP/1.1"" 429 1018 ""-"" ""curl/7.36.0"" |0/466110|


Curl Client gets 500, somehow.


There's also been a bug filed few years back on Bugzilla #900827. I remember reading that it has been fixed in 2.2.18. Yet, I still face the problem -- which leads me to think there's probably a different problem altogether.
Questions

As I have read elsewhere, Apache might not relay the code perfectly for custom HTTP status codes. But isn't HTTP 429 as a part of additional HTTP status codes RFC, a standard code enough to be recognised and relayed?
Is there something crucial that I am missing here?

PS: Since this question is more about HTTP status spec, I asked here. If the community feels its more about apache, please feel free to vote to move the question to Server Fault.","
I just stumbled upon your question because i was once again researching a similar problem, where our Apache Reverse Proxy returned a 500 status code on an ActiveSync Response 449. 
I also found the Bugzilla entry you mentioned and the statments that it should have been fixed with version 2.2.18, however we use 2.2.22 and still faced the problem. 
After further reading into the comments in the Bugzilla entry which then lead to the apache bug entry #44995. Reading these comments, especially the last one lead me to the believe that the issue, especially with custom error codes without status message has not been fixed in any 2.2.x versions but is included in 2.3/2.4
So we moved on and updated our reverse proxy to a 2.4 version, and to our surprise the error code 449 was correctly passed over by the proxy.
As you didnt mentioned your apache2 version used, i can only guess that an update to 2.4 or 2.3 might be a possible solution for you.

To fix, I did this:

ls -l in the directory causing the issue (mine was public_html)
You should see the index file (e.g. index.php) that should be causing the issue. It is due to a root user having the only permission to the file and not your CPanel (or system) username. (note this system/cpanel name)

Where is the problem?
What is the right way to load a web assembly file?","
I finally found what is the right way to load a wasm application in a wasm-bindgen project!
In fact, everything was on this page
When you compile the project without wanting to run it with a bundler, you have to run wasm-pack build with a --target flag.
wasm-pack build --release --target web.
This creates a .js file (pkg/test_wasm.js in my example) with everything you need to load the wasm-application.
And then this is how you use the functions created by wasm-bindgen (index.js):
import init from './pkg/test_wasm.js';
import {ex_function, ex_Struct ...} from '../pkg/test_wasm.js';

function run {
    // use the function ex_function1 here

}

init().then(run)

You include your index.js in your HTML file
<script type=""module"" src=""./index.js""></script>

And then it work's !
Edit:
Now that's I understand the javascript ecosystem a bit more, I cab try to explain what I understand:
There are many ways to do imports in js, here is a list :
https://dev.to/iggredible/what-the-heck-are-cjs-amd-umd-and-esm-ikm
You don't need to know much about that, except that the default target of wasm-pack is a node style ecmascript module. This import will work in node.js, but not directly in the browser. So in node, you can import a function from a wasm file directly, like so:
import {ex_function} from ""./test.wasm""
But these styles of import don't work in the browser right now. Maybe it will be possible in the future
But for now, your browser only knows about js modules. So if you try to import a .wasm file directly in the browser, it will throw a mime type error because it doesn't know how to deal with webassembly files.
The tool you use to go from ecmascipt modules (with a lot of nmp packages for example) to a single js file is called a web-bundler (webpack, rollup, snowpack ...). If you work on a big project with npm, you probably need one. Otherwise, the ""--target web"" will say  to wasm-bindgen to instantiate the wasm module the right way (look at the pkg/test_wasm.js)

49,title:Increase PHP-FPM idle timeout setting,"description:We have recently migrated to PHP-FPM. However we have encountered a problem with some long running scripts. The code looks roughly like:

The normal PHP script time limit is also 30 secs. This was previously working fine in that we reset the remaining time limit back to 30 secs for each item. There are around 1000 items meaning the script in total would normally take about 30 mins to complete. However we have since reached the following problem:

Now my question is, is it sensible to increase the idle timeout to something like an hour but still ensure the PHP scripts don't run for longer than 30 secs, unless we use set_time_limit? Is there a way to set the idle timeout on a per script basis (something akin to a set_time_limit?)
Here is our pool configuration:

And here is our fastcgi.conf","
I have found my self in similar situation with long running processes and php-fpm and fastcgi when migrated from mod_php. 
The error you are seeing is from apache's fastcgi proxy who killed connection to php-fpm pool because your script did not outputted anything for 30 seconds. 
You can change idle-timeout in your apache config to extend it (cannot be 0):
FastCgiExternalServer /usr/lib/cgi-bin/php7-fcgi -socket /run/php/php7.0-fpm.sock -idle-timeout 1800 -pass-header Authorization

Chain goes like this: Apache -> FastCgiExternalServer proxy -> php-fpm pool server -> php process
Apache proxy kills connection to php, so setting max_execution_time or set_time_limit from php doesn't matter.
AFAIK if php is being run on Apache via mod_fastcgi, there is no way to set per script time limits from php code or .user.ini or via apache (.htaccess). So that means that by extending it in one place you are extending timeout for eg. both your frontend and backend users. Alternatively you could separate it via 2 vhosts and define different timeout values there.

Your are partially done.. you can restart the apache and shouldn't find any errors.

In your Django project root folder, add apache folder and create django.wsgi (don't change this name) and apache_mydjango.conf.

In httpd.conf add the following line at the bottom of the page.
Include ""d:/projects/mysite/apache_django_wsgi.conf""

sys.path.append('d:/projects/mysite')
os.environ['DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE'] = 'mysite.settings'

import django.core.handlers.wsgi

Per http://enable-cors.org/server_apache.html, in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf, configure Access-Control-Allow-Origin: 
<Directory />
    # Add the following line to enable CORS to connect to local elasticsearch.
    Header set Access-Control-Allow-Origin ""localhost:9200""
    AllowOverride none
    Require all denied
</Directory>

Per https://jsbroadcast.com/elastic-search-cors/, in elasticsearch-1.7.0/config/elasticsearch.yml add:
http.cors.enabled : true // 
http.cors.allow-origin: ""/.*/""
http.cors.allow-methods : OPTIONS, HEAD, GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
http.cors.allow-headers : ""X-Requested-With,X-Auth-Token,Content-Type, Content-Length, Authorization""

I can now run the client.ping call without any error.

After that when I try to run the container accepting connections from the host in the 80 port I get this:  

Any help?","
It is saying port 80 is busy ... run this to see who is using port 80
sudo netstat -tlnp | grep 80 # sudo apt-get install net-tools # to install netstat

tcp        0      0 0.0.0.0:80              0.0.0.0:*               LISTEN      1380/nginx -g daemo

scroll to far right to see offending PID of process holding port 80 ... its PID 1380 so lets do a process list to see that pid
ps -eaf | grep 1380

root      1380     1  0 11:33 ?        00:00:00 nginx: master process /usr/sbin/nginx -g daemon on; master_process on;

so teardown that offending process to free up the port 80
sudo kill 1380  # if you know the pid ( 1380 for example )

__ or __
sudo fuser -k 80/tcp #  just kill whatever pid is using port 80 tcp

If after doing above its still saying busy then probably the process which you killed got auto relaunched in which case you need to kill off its watcher however you can walk up the process tree from netstat output to identify this parent process and kill that too
Here is how to identify the parent pid of a given process pid
ps -eafww

eve         2720    2718  0 07:56 ?        00:00:00 /usr/share/skypeforlinux/skypeforlinux --type=zygote

in above pid is 2720 and its parent will be the next column to right pid 2718 ...  there are commands to show a process tree to visualize these relationships
ps -x --forest  

or
pstree  -p

261,title:Proper .htaccess config for Next.js SSG,"description:NextJS exports a static site with the following structure:

I'm using an .htaccess file to hide the .html extensions:

Everything works flawlessly, EXCEPT:

If I follow a link to domain/article it displays the article.html page, but my address bar shows domain/article <--Good.
If I refresh, I get sent to address: domain/article/ (note trailing slash) which lists the contents of the article directory <--Bad (same thing with Tag)
Similarly, manually typing in domain/article takes me to domain/article/ instead of showing article.html without the .html extension.

So...

How do I fix this?
Is this an .htaccess issue?
A nextjs config issue?
(Wouldn't it be    better for NextJS to create a article\index.html instead of a file in the root directory?)


exportTrailingSlash
I tried playing around with exportTrailingSlash which seems related, but this created other problems like always having a trailing slash at the end of all my links:
Eg: if I go to domain/article/somearticle and hit refresh, something (.httaccess?) is adding a / to the end to give me domain/article/somearticle/ not horrible, just not very clean and inconsistent...
Edit: Actually, it's a little more horrible, because sometimes we get a trailing slash, sometimes we don't on the nextjs links... must be something about how I'm using <Link /> but I can't figure that out.
Regardless, NONE of the .htaccess rules I've tried successfully remove the trailing slash all the time every time...

More details:
In my next app, I have folder:

In various pages, I use nextJS Link component:","
If you request /article and /article exists as a physical directory then Apache's mod_dir, will (by default) append the trailing slash in order to ""fix"" the URL. This is achieved with a 301 permanent redirect - so it will be cached by the browser.
Although having a physical directory with the same basename as a file and using extensionless URLs creates an ambiguity. eg. Is /article supposed to access the directory /article/ or the file /article.html. You don't seem to want to allow direct access to directories anyway, so that would seem to resolve that ambiguity.
To prevent Apache mod_dir appending the trailing slash to directories we need to disable the DirectorySlash. For example:
DirectorySlash Off

But as mentioned, if you have previously visited /article then the redirect to /article/ will have been cached by the browser - so you'll need to clear the browser cache before this will be effective.
Since you are removing the file extension you also need to ensure that MultiViews is disabled, otherwise, mod_negotiation will issue an internal subrequest for the underlying file, and potentially conflict with mod_rewrite. MultiViews is disabled by default, although some shared hosts do enable it for some reason. From the output you are getting it doesn't look like MultiViews is enabled, but better to be sure...
# Ensure that MutliViews is disabled
Options -MultiViews

However, if you need to be able to access the directory itself then you will need to manually append the trailing slash with an internal rewrite. Although this does not seem to be a requirement here. You should, however, ensure that directory listings are disabled:
# Disable directory listings
Options -Indexes

Attempting to access any directory (that does not ultimately map to a file - see below) and does not contain a DirectoryIndex document will return a 403 Forbidden response, instead of a directory listing.
Note that the only difference that could occur between following a link to domain/article, refreshing the page and manually typing domain/article is caching... either by the browser or any intermediary proxy caches. (Unless you have JavaScript that intercepts the click event on the anchor?!)
You do still need to rewrite requests from /foo to /foo.html OR /foo to /foo/index.html (see below), depending on how you have configured your site. Although it would be preferable that you choose one or the other, rather than both (as you seem to imply could be the case).

RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME}\.html -f
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ $1.html


It is unclear how this is seemingly ""working"" for you currently - unless you are seeing a cached response? When you request /article, the first condition fails because this exists as a physical directory and the rule is not processed. Even with MultiViews enabled, mod_dir will take priority and append the trailing slash.
The second condition that checks the existence of the .html file isn't necessarily checking the same file that is being rewritten to. eg. If you request /foo/bar, where /foo.html exists, but there is no physical directory /foo then the RewriteCond directive checks for the existence of /foo.html - which is successful, but the request is internally rewritten to /foo/bar.html (from the captured RewriteRule pattern) - this results in an internal rewrite loop and a 500 error response being returned to the client. See my answer to the following ServerFault question that goes into more detail behind what is actually happening here.
We can also make a further optimisation if we assume that any URL that contains what looks like a file extension (eg. your static resources .css, .js and image files) should be ignored, otherwise we are performing filesystem checks on every request, which is relatively expensive.
So, in order to map (internally rewrite) requests of the form /article to /article.html and /article/somearticle to /article/somearticle.html you would need to modify the above rule to read something like:
# Rewrite /foo to /foo.html if it exists
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI}.html -f
RewriteRule !\.\w{2,4}$ %{REQUEST_URI}.html [L]

There is no need to backslash escape a literal dot in the RewriteCond TestString - the dot carries no special meaning here; it's not a regex.
Then, to handle requests of the form /foo that should map to /foo/index.html you can do something like the following:
# Rewrite /foo to /foo/index.html if it exists
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI}/index.html -f
RewriteRule !\.\w{2,4}$ %{REQUEST_URI}/index.html [L]

Ordinarily, you would allow mod_dir to serve the DirectoryIndex (eg. index.html), but having omitted the trailing slash from the directory, this can be problematic.
Summary
Bringing the above points together, we have:
# Disable directory indexes and MultiViews
Options -Indexes -MultiViews

# Prevent mod_dir appending a slash to directory requests
DirectorySlash Off

RewriteEngine On

# Rewrite /foo to /foo.html if it exists
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI}.html -f
RewriteRule !\.\w{2,4}$ %{REQUEST_URI}.html [L]

# Otherwise, rewrite /foo to /foo/index.html if it exists
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}%{REQUEST_URI}/index.html -f
RewriteRule !\.\w{2,4}$ %{REQUEST_URI}/index.html [L]

This could be further optimised, depending on your site structure and whether you are adding any more directives to the .htaccess file. For example:

you could check for file extensions on the requested URL at the top of the file to prevent any further processing. The RewriteRule regex on each subsequent rule could then be ""simplified"".
Requests that include a trailing slash could be blocked or redirected (to remove the trailing slash).
If the request is for a .html file then redirect to the extensionless URL. This is made slightly more complicated if you are dealing with both /foo.html and /foo/index.html. But this is only really necessary if you are changing an existing URL structure.

For example, implementing #1 and #2 above, would enable the directives to be written like so:
# Disable directory indexes and MultiViews
Options -Indexes -MultiViews

# Prevent mod_dir appending a slash to directory requests
DirectorySlash Off

RewriteEngine On

# Prevent any further processing if the URL already ends with a file extension
RewriteRule \.\w{2,4}$ - [L]

# Redirect any requests to remove a trailing slash
RewriteRule (.*)/$ /$1 [R=301,L]

# Rewrite /foo to /foo.html if it exists
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/$1.html -f
RewriteRule (.*) $1.html [L]

# Otherwise, rewrite /foo to /foo/index.html if it exists
RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT}/$1/index.html -f
RewriteRule (.*) $1/index.html [L]

Always test with a 302 (temporary) redirect before changing to a 301 (permanent) redirect in order to avoid caching issues.

Or... is there a better way.","
The problem:
session_start() relies on $_COOKIE[session_name()], so, if you edit the cookie value to something like #$#$FDSFSR#""#""$""#$"" or simply empty it (not delete the cookie) and refresh a page with your code:
if (!session_id()) {
    session_start();
}

The following warning is generated:

PHP Warning:  session_start(): The session id is too long or contains
illegal characters, valid characters are a-z, A-Z, 0-9 and '-,' in
/home/username/public_html/session_start.php on line 7

This happens because php is checking if session_id() exists and, in fact, it exists, but contains illegal characters not allowed as session_id name.
A valid session id may contain only digits, letters A to Z (both upper and lower case), comma and dash ([-,a-zA-Z0-9]) between 1 and 128 characters.

My solution:
Check if $_COOKIE[session_name()] is set and contains a valid session_id prior to session_start(), otherwise, delete the session cookie and only then  session_start(), something like:
function safeSession() {
    if (isset($_COOKIE[session_name()]) AND preg_match('/^[-,a-zA-Z0-9]{1,128}$/', $_COOKIE[session_name()])) {
        session_start();
    } elseif (isset($_COOKIE[session_name()])) {
        unset($_COOKIE[session_name()]);
        session_start(); 
    } else {
        session_start(); 
    }
}

start the session:
safeSession();


NOTES:
1 - session_name is defined on your php.ini as session.name = SOMETHING (default is PHPSESSID), so, you may be looking for a cookie matching session.name. You can use the session_name() function to retrieve it.
2 - Session cookie manipulation can be used by hackers to dump information from your server (username and path) if ini_set('display_errors', 1); is set.
3 - session_regenerate_id(true) works but, because it checks the current session_id prior to assign a new one, generates warnings.
4 - I've tested the code with several invalid session names and no errors or warnings were generated, everything worked and intended.

I managed to sort it myself.
As I was using the server provided by my university I had no access to install the required module (HTML::Entities).
I decided to then set up the required module on my own Apache web server on a virtual machine and managed to get it working this way after sorting out some syntax/spelling errors.
The way I installed the HTML::Entities module was through the synaptic package manager, just by searching libhtml-parser-perl the module was found and installed. 
I restarted Apache and the VM just in case that was required.
Thanks for everybody's input!

I have both of ServiceUnavailableRetryStrategy and HttpRequestRetryHandler set. And from both, it seems that only ServiceUnavailableRetryStrategy has a delay option, where i dont see any delay options for httpRequestRetryHandler.
So in the case of the NoHttpResponseException above, which one is actually used ? And what's the difference between those two ?","

HttpRequestRetryHandler represents a strategy determining whether or not the request is safe to retry in case of an I/O error (no HTTP response has been received from the server).
ServiceUnavailableRetryStrategy represents a strategy determining whether or not the request should be retried after a while in case of the service being temporarily unavailable (response status 503).

In 5.0 the two interfaces are likely to get replaced by a single strategy interface.

The file itself is encoded as UTF-8. However, Apache insists on declaring ISO-8859-1 and the error message is mangled:

If I manually change encoding to UTF-8 in my browser text looks correct.
Site has been granted all permissions:

... and there's nothing relevant in Apache logs.
What bit am I missing?","
Terrific question!! I must say. I had to dig all my resources and read lot of manuals to find the reason for this behavior.
It appears to be a known behavior but not very well covered in official manuals. Finally, I found one reference of it in this Apache manual:

suppress-error-charset
Available in versions after 2.0.54
When Apache issues a redirect in response to a client request, the
  response includes some actual text to be displayed in case the client
  can't (or doesn't) automatically follow the redirection. Apache
  ordinarily labels this text according to the character set which it
  uses, which is ISO-8859-1.
However, if the redirection is to a page that uses a different
  character set, some broken browser versions will try to use the
  character set from the redirection text rather than the actual page.
  This can result in Greek, for instance, being incorrectly rendered.
Setting this environment variable causes Apache to omit the character
  set for the redirection text, and these broken browsers will then
  correctly use that of the destination page.

And that is exactly the behavior you're seeing that charset=iso-8859-1 is coming in the headers.

How to fix:
Have your .htaccess code like this:
# set desired env variable to suppress iso-8859-1 charset
SetEnvIf Host ^ suppress-error-charset

# set desired 403 message with desired charset 
ErrorDocument 403 ""<html><head><meta http-equiv='Content-Type' content='text/html; charset=utf-8'></head><body>Error 403 - Esta ubicaci闁荤姵鍔楅悵?no es p闂佺粯鎼╁Σ鍣噄ca</body></html>""

Please note that SetEnvIf Host ^ is a condition that will always hold true hence suppress-error-charset will always be set. I have tested just with those 2 lines in my .htaccess and got correct error message displayed in my browser.

I made a script that generates statistics table for my site. This script generates over 2000 tables that are used for different statistics data with a different granularity like:

tables by years
tables by day
tables by users
tables by user_agent

etc... (don't ask me why this, it was made by the previous so called architect -  altought they load in less than 0.02 seconds)
So I updated the script to add new tables but i made a mistake.
I put a space in the table name and now I cannot delete it. so i try to put a \ to escape it but no success:","
You have to use the ` - This will treat the string passed as the actual table name and not a bunch of commands you want to execute.
root@summary:reports> drop table `xd_2012_02_\ ua`;

This should show:
Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

I would recommend to use the ` not only for this case, but also that will prevent errors if you use reserved MySQL words like type or desc (as description) for columns or table names. This might save you headaches later. Although, using reserved or special characters is not a good practice, but that's just me.

The problem happens because the signature of the method has variable arguments. When a method is invoked, there are 3 phases during which all applicable methods are searched. Methods with variable arguments are searched in phase 3 where boxing, and unboxing is also allowed.
So both xor(boolean...) and xor(Boolean...) are applicable here because boxing is taken into account. When multiple methods are applicable, only the most specific is invoked. But in this case, boolean and Boolean can't be compared, so there is no more specific method, hence the compiler error: both methods match.
A workaround is to create an explicit array:
public static void main(String[] args) {
    xor(new boolean[] { true, false }); // will call the primitive xor
    xor(new Boolean[] { Boolean.TRUE, Boolean.FALSE }); // will call the non-primitive xor

146,title:How to prevent 'IOError: failed to write data' when client closes connection to Django/WSGI app?,"description:I have an iPhone app that is using web services implemented in Python, using Django and Piston, running on an apache server through WSGI.
Sometimes the app closes its connection to the server before a call is finished.  When it does this it causes a:

to appear in my server's error logs.
I can ""fix"" the problem in the app by not explicitly closing the connection, but just leaving it to finish downloading and ignoring the result.  However, I'd like fix this on the server-side if possible.  How can I do it?","
[disclaimer: this is a ""why it can't be easily done"" explanation, not a solution] 
As @Slott pointed out, this is definitely the technically correct behavior when stream.close or stream.write is called on a closed socket. However, I understand the motivation for the question... in the context of a wsgi app, clients terminating the connection after a full or partial read is not an ""exceptional"" behavior, it happens all the time. For it to be left unhandled leaves the impression it was unexpected / the code was unprepared for this, when in fact it's expected, and shouldn't be worthy of note. So it'd be nice to fix.
The catch is that you'd have to find a way to distinguish cases... 

Situations like ""client read 'Status: 304', and then closed connection"" or ""client read all bytes, and then closed connection, even though it had requested connection should be reused"" are ones where it would be appropriate to not issue any sort of logging besides a log.debug() call. 
But situations like ""client stopped reading in the middle of file because connection died when an ISP router had a stroke"" are worthy of an error being logged. Something didn't successfully complete, and any transactional state your server app builtup should be rolled back. In which case IOError propagating upwards is the right thing to do.

Such errors are only silenceable if at every place they could be raised, the code is modified to distinguish those two cases. Until then, the wsgi authors seem to have erred on the side of caution. So there isn't a quick fix for this that I know of.

(Also, I should note this isn't django-specific, I use paste+pylons and have the same thing happen)

342,"title:OpenCart 3.0.2.0 - force SSL and fix ""www"" .htaccess","description:I am working on a fresh install that runs on OpenCart 3.0.2.0.
I bought a SSL certificate and my host activated it. I then proceeded to activate SSL from OpenCart's admin (System->Settings->Server->Use SSL) and, after editing the config file, it works as intended by OpenCart (only on the pages that have forms).
However, I want the ceritificate to be visible on all pages.
Besides, OpenCart has some problems when typing the URL of the website with ""www"" before the domain name that causes font-awesome icons to not load. I could edit the config.php file and add the ""www"" in there but that would mess up the URL without the ""www"".
Figured out that the only way to force SSL on all pages AND fix the ""www"" problem as well is to edit my .htaccess file.
I tried adding this to force SSL on all pages with no results:

Looked over the internet and SO and found multiple variants of forcing SSL and the ""www"" version to work properly but none of them seemed to work for me, maybe I didn't understood what they were aimed to achieve correctly.
This is how my default .htaccess file looks:

How should a complete, working .htaccess look like for OC 3.0.2.0 to force SSL and fix the ""www"" problem?
Would be nice if the code would not include my website's URL and generally work for any OC 3.0.2.0 installation so that it can further be used by the community without any further tweaking.","
I managed to fix it. Here's how I did it: 
Right under the comment after RewriteEngine On I added the following code:
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

This seems to redirect both the www and non www version to https://domain-name.com

If you want to redirect the non-www to the www version then you need to replace this line:
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.

With this line:
RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www\.

And make sure the lines where the redirect takes place include the ""www"" like this:
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://www.%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

Note: Make sure to specify the www or non-www URL in your website's config files located in the public_html and admin folders according to preference.

In order to make it work for all links I had to open the config.php file located in my public_html folder and change my domain name to include https everywhere (including in the first HTTP section).
However, when I tried to access my admin page via SSL my CSS wasn't displayed. Fixed this by editing the config.php file that is in the admin folder in the same way. Didn't had to change it for both HTTPS and HTTP. I just changed it in the HTTPS section to include https://

Although I would really like to get an answer to this, I have decided to take another approach so I can move on. It seems this question is not spurring enough attention and I don't feel like a bounty right now, so I disabled logging to a file for now. I am going to redesign my approach anyway, so this seems like a decent idea.
What I came up with temporarily that seems to work and not give errors is this (for the file handler definition):
'file': {
    'level': 'DEBUG',
    'class': 'logging.FileHandler',
    'filename': '/some/fixed/path/to/logs/django.log',
},

Note that before I was using a value derived from os.path.join(PROJECT_PATH, 'logs/django.log'). Not sure why this didn't work, but it was the culprit. So even though this bit was correct: PROJECT_PATH = os.path.abspath(os.path.dirname(__name__)) (even confirmed in the python shell), it wasn't working in production.

168,title:Log all requests to file Django,"description:When I run the django development server (./manage.py runserver) all requested urls are conveniently logged into process stdout, with the precise time and the response code:

It is very handy because when analysing output you immediately see the request corresponding to your log messages, for example:

I used to work with uwsgi+nginx, so I used 'console' logging handler for everything, and then started uwsgi like this:

As a result I got all the necessary logging in /var/log/uwsgi.log, uwsgi's request records and my own logging messages.
Now I want to achieve the same result with Apache+mod WSGI+django. I want the only file to contain all requests and all the logs from my django app in one place.
I've tried to achieve this with Django logging configuration, but even when I redirect django.requests to the same file I get only my own messages in the logs, no requests at all. Here is the portion of the configuration:

Is there a way to achieve nginx+uwsgi+django logging behavior with apache+WSGI+django? Or the only way is to keep apache access.log and my logs in separate files?
I guess in the first case it was development server who logged requests, and in the second case it was uwsgi process. Maybe there's a way to tell WSGIDaemonProcess to do the same?","
For a standard Apache installation you are going against what is regarded as best practice by trying to mingle both access logs and error logs. Traditionally they have been left separate so that analysis could be done on access logs on server traffic.
That said, have you tried changing the ErrorLog and CustomLog directives in Apache to use the same file?
When I used mod_wsgi-express with the command:

So technically it should work for a standalone Apache installation with both error and access log going to the same file just by setting ErrorLog and CustomLog to the same file.
As for additional Django logging it may generate internally due to exceptions, you still would also need:
LOGGING = {
    'version': 1,
    'disable_existing_loggers': False,
    'handlers': {
        'console': {
            'class': 'logging.StreamHandler',
        },
    },
    'loggers': {
        'django': {
            'handlers': ['console'],
            'level': os.getenv('DJANGO_LOG_LEVEL', 'INFO'),
        },
    },
}

This tells Django to notionally log to the terminal, which mod_wsgi will intercept and send to the Apache error log, which with the above will be the combined application log.
BTW, if wanting to run Apache/mod_wsgi in a container where logging needs to go to standard output, do not do it yourself. Use mod_wsgi-express as it is specifically designed for use in containers. In that case you would just use:
mod_wsgi-express start-server --access-log --log-to-terminal

if want to enable access logging (off by default as generally just noise for container deployments) and it will worry about sending both access and error logs to the terminal so Docker can capture it.
If need more information or assistance, use the mod_wsgi mailing list.

Below is how I fixed (with a lot of help) the problem. 
This answer assumes you have the following project structure:

      - settings.py
      - wsgi.py
    - myapp

      - static
        - myapp
          - ...

Digression
I was facing the problem where I got an error in my apahce error.log which said it could not find settings. This issue is most likely caused by an error in your python-path. This portion assumes that you are using the daemon method (recommended by docs). 

Check your wsgi.py file and make sure it says myproject.settings instead of settings in os.environ.setdefault("" ... "", "" ... "")
Check and double check your python-path which should be something like 
WSGIDaemonProcess [any-name] python-path=/home/[username]/myproject:/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages

This should fix the problem (at least it did for me).

RE: Points (1), (2)
(1). Change the document root to the head of the directory which contains your django project files. In this case, I changed it to /home/[username]/myproject. Do not use ~/ for reference. I tried that and it didn't seem to pan out. 
(2). If you are serving your static files from the same server then make sure you have set a STATIC_ROOT and STATIC_URL in your settings.py file. In my case, I set STATIC_URL to /static/ and STATIC_ROOT to /var/www/[any-name]/static/. When you decide to deploy, you will have to run sudo python manage.py collectstatic.
Also note that it should be Alias /static not Alias /static/ (note the trailing slash). The docs show /static/ but that is incorrect and will not work when you try and serve static files (apache does not complete the path).
That's it. All of these steps got my server up and running. If you have any questions, feel free to comment and I will try to help out. Good luck!

180,title:PHP (Apache) silently converting HTTP 429 and others to 500,"description:I just discovered an oddity in PHP's header() method silently converting some of my statuses to 500.  Since I had no luck in finding mention of this behavior in various web searches, I'm adding this here in the hope of saving others some aggravation, but also to ask if anyone has discovered a better workaround (either with PHP or Zend1) than I've come up with.
Given a simple PHP script like:

I would expect to receive something like:

Instead, it actually returns:

Adding to the mystery, there are no events in my apache error log, and the access log shows the correct status code (thus different from what got sent to the browser):

Everything works fine when testing with many other status codes like 401, 420, 426.
Everything also works fine if I am explicit and send header('HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests');  This would be a useful workaround except that I'm using Zend Framework and its setHttpResponseCode method expects an integer, which it uses as the third parameter to php's header() function.
I've since discovered that it seems to apply specifically to statuses added in RFC 6585 (see https://github.com/php/php-src/pull/274), though I'm a little confused why statuses like 426 work when they're clearly not present in the source code for 5.4.14 and 5.4.16 (the two versions I've tested against) but non-functional ones like 429 are.
Update:
As answers have indicated, this is mostly an Apache issue, not PHP,  I've updated the title accordingly.  Most interesting seems to be that this is fixed only in certain versions of Apache (with no apparent consistency between old and new).  I believe the upstream issue in question is here: https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44995","
It's Apache, 99% sure, I can't find it direcly in it's docs, but I can infer it from the test below (Apache version  2.2.22)
Add this in your config:
ErrorDocument 429 Aaargh to heavy

Restart:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
Syntax error on line 6 of /etc/apache2/conf.d/localized-error-pages:
Unsupported HTTP response code 429
Action 'configtest' failed.
The Apache error log may have more information.
   ...fail!

429 also seems a recent addition in rfc6585, status: proposed, date: April 2012. One year old for HTTP RFCs is... just a baby in my experience. Add to that the process of getting it in Apache, and then in your package repositories... Well, you could try Apache 2.4...

183,title:Wordpress apache2 virtual host configuration on a debian install,"description:I'm trying to setup a wordpress site on my server that also hosts another website. I can only get the wordpress site to work with the web address blog.murmilosoftware.com/wp. 
I want to be able to simply access it from blog.murmilosoftware.com. 
The problem is when I type blog.murmilosoftware.com in right now it displays the same page that is available from murmilosoftware.com. 
I have attached both of the sites-available config files from /etc/apache2/sites-available.
blog.murmillosoftware.com.conf 

murmillosoftware.com.conf","
Do you notice the <VirtualHost *:80> in your murmillosoftware.com.conf file? That is called the Virtual Host configuration. In your current blog.murmillosoftware.com.conf, all you're doing is creating an alias to /wp path, which is why you're able to browse wordpress there.
Update your blog.murmillosoftware.com.conf as follows (might be buggy, keep checking server logs):
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin erik@murmillosoftware.com
    ServerName blog.murmillosoftware.com
    DocumentRoot /usr/share/wordpress

    # Custom log files, to differentiate from root server
